## Complicit poster text

**If you work for this White House**

**You are complicit**

In hate-mongering(1), lies(2), corrupt taking of Americans’ tax money via self-dealing(3) and emoluments(4), and quite possibly federal crimes and treason.  Also, any wars will be on your soul.

Yes, to chase ratings, broadcast media amplified misinformation about Hillary Clinton and put the president on the air continuously.  That’s how we got to this point.  Read widely, and question motivations.
